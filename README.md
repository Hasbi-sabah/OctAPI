## Features

OctAPI provides a seamless way to explore and manage your API routes within Visual Studio Code. Here are its key features:

- **Framework Support** â€“ Works with Express, NestJS, and Koa, with Python frameworks coming soon.
- **Jump to Code** â€“ Clicking a route takes you directly to the exact line where it's defined.
- **Flexible Organization** â€“ Toggle between grouping by basepath or HTTP method.
- **Native Sidebar Integration** â€“ View all detected routes directly in VS Codeâ€™s sidebar.
